Easy Awesome Library

===

This is primarily for the use of easy graphics (or possibly game development) for the all round novice.

It doesn't use OpenGL or DirectX just the simple stuff, so don't expect to make any 3D games on this.

This isn't a public release, just a... thing.

SUPPORT

Unfortunately, as this uses WinForms; it is unable to run on Linux.
